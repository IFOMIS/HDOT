        <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">depressed mood episode</rdfs:label>
        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&obo;MD_0000024"/>
        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The criteria below are based on the formal DSM-IV criteria for a Major Depressive Episode. A diagnoses of major depressive episode requires that the patient has—over a two-week period—experienced five or more of the symptoms below, and these must be outside the patient&apos;s normal behaviour. Either depressed mood or decreased interest or pleasure must be one of the five (although both are frequently concomitant).

Mood
    For the better part of nearly every day, the patient reports a depressed mood or appears depressed to others.
        The patient may state that he or she has been feeling sad, depressed, blue, empty, &quot;down in the dumps,&quot; hopeless, etc. If the patient is in denial about these feelings, yet appears to be on the verge of tearfulness, manifests a depressed facial expression and disposition, or appears to be overly irritable, these may also indicate the presence of depressed mood. Some people may report physical complaints (i.e., aches, pains, headaches) rather than depressed mood, and physical symptoms without physical cause are sometimes indicators of depression.

Anhedonia and loss of interest

    For most of nearly every day, interest or pleasure is markedly decreased in nearly all activities (noted by the patient or by others).
        People suffering with depression tend to lose interest in things they once found enjoyable. Activities are no longer enjoyable and there is often a loss of interest in or desire for sex. People who are depressed may say, &quot;I just don&apos;t care anymore,&quot; or &quot;nothing matters anymore.&quot; Friends and family of the depressed person may notice that he/she has withdrawn from friends, or has neglected or quit doing activities that were once a source of enjoyment.

Change in eating, appetite, or weight

    Although not dieting, there is a marked loss or gain of weight (such as 5% in one month) or appetite is markedly decreased or increased nearly every day.
    Changes in appetite take on two manifestations: under- or over-eating.
        In the first instance, some people never feel hungry, can go long periods without wanting to eat, may forget to eat, or if they do eat a small amount of food may be sufficient. A reduction in weight is often associated with a melancholic type of depression.
        In the second instance, some people tend toward an increase in appetite and may gain significant amounts of weight. They may tend to crave certain types of food such as sweets or carbohydrates. People with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) often crave foods high in carbohydrates. Weight gain is often associated with atypical depression.

Sleep

    Nearly every day the patient sleeps excessively, known as hypersomnia, or not enough, known as insomnia.
        Insomnia is the most common type of sleep disturbance for people who are clinically depressed. Having difficulty falling asleep at night is known as &quot;initial&quot; insomnia; waking in the middle of the night and being unable to go back to sleep as &quot;middle insomnia&quot;, and; waking too early as &quot;terminal insomnia&quot;. Insomnia is often associated with a melancholic type of depression.
        A less frequent sleeping problem is oversleeping (called &quot;hypersomnia&quot;). This may occur in the form of sleeping for prolonged periods at night or increased sleeping during the daytime. Even with excess sleep, a person may still feel tired and sluggish during the day. People with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) may sleep longer during the winter months. Hypersomnia is often associated with an atypical depression.

Motor activity

    Nearly every day others can see that the patient&apos;s activity is agitated or slow.
        People suffering from depression may be either quite agitated (psychomotor agitation), or very lethargic (psychomotor retardation) in their mannerisms and behavior. If a person is agitated, he or she may find it difficult to sit still, may pace the room, wring his/her hands, or fidget with clothes or objects. Someone with psychomotor retardation tends to move sluggishly, may move across a room very slowly, avert his/her eyes, sit slumped in a chair and speak slowly, saying little.
        In terms of diagnosis, the agitation or slowing down of one&apos;s demeanor must be to the degree that it can be observed by others.

Fatigue

    Nearly every day the person experiences extreme fatigue.[3]
        A decrease in energy and feeling fatigued are very common symptoms for those who are clinically depressed. A person may feel tired without having engaged in any physical activity, and day-to-day tasks become difficult, including getting washed and dressed in the morning. Job tasks or housework become very tiring, and the person finds that his/her work at home, school, or on the job suffers.[4]

Self-worth

    Nearly every day the patient feels worthless or inappropriately guilty. These feelings are not just about being depressed, they may be delusional.
        Depressed people may think of themselves in very negative, unrealistic ways such as manifesting a preoccupation with past &quot;failures&quot;, personalisation of trivial events, or believing that minor mistakes prove their inadequacy. They also may have an unrealistic sense of personal responsibility and see things beyond their control as being their fault. Additionally, self-loathing is common in clinical depression, and can lead to a downward spiral when combined with other symptoms.

Concentration

    Noted by the patient or by others, nearly every day the patient is indecisive or has trouble thinking or concentrating.
        A person with depression frequently experiences negative and pessimistic thoughts, and reports that his/her ability to think, concentrate, or make decisions becomes impaired. Memory and distraction problems are common. This problem can be notably pronounced, causing significant difficulty in functioning for those involved in intellectually demanding activities.

Thoughts of death

    The patient has had repeated thoughts about death (other than the fear of dying), suicide (with or without a plan) or has made a suicide attempt.
        The frequency and intensity of thoughts about suicide can range from believing that friends and family would be better off if one were dead, to frequent thoughts about committing suicide (generally related to wishing to stop the emotional pain), to detailed plans about how the suicide would be carried out. Less severely suicidal people may have regular thoughts of suicide, while those who are more severely suicidal may have made specific plans and decided upon a day and location for the suicide attempt.
            Thoughts of suicide occur mostly when triggered. Thoughts of suicide happen more frequently than normal.

Diagnostic caveats

In diagnosing the symptoms a trained therapist must take the following into account:

    These symptoms must cause clinically important distress, or impair work, social or personal functioning, and they should not fulfil the criteria for Mixed Episode.
    The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., abuse of a drug or medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism).
    Other than in the case of severe symptoms (severely impaired functioning, severe preoccupation with worthlessness, ideas of suicide, delusions or hallucinations or psychomotor retardation), the episode should not have begun within two months of the loss of a loved one.

Depression is considered a heterogeneous condition in which different biologic abnormalities may be present such as a significant weight loss or gain, too little or too much sleep, physical agitation or slowing down, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, lowered ability to think, to concentrate or make decisions and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.

More specifically, it is a condition of persistent and uncontrollable nervousness, stress, and worry that is triggered by anticipation of future events, memories of past events, or ruminations over day-to-day events, both trivial and major, with disproportionate fears of catastrophic consequences.

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Pain can be defined as a multidimensional phenomenon that is the result of a complex interaction between physiological, psychological, cognitive, social, and other factors. It is the result of a physiological series of electrical and chemical events that occur in the body. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as &quot;an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage&quot; (Merskey, Bogduk, 1994).

High levels of pain and depression are generally associated with poor cognitive functioning (attention, information processing speed, working memory capacity, reasoning ability, and verbal memory). It seems that depression mediates the relationship between pain and cognitive functioning (Brown et al., 2002). In other words, chronic pain causes depression, which causes impairment in cognitive functioning.

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Cancer-associated loss or reduction in appetite can result from medical conditions, such as from local effects of a tumour, the host response to the tumour and anticancer therapies.

Loss of appetite may lead to malnutrition, which in turn has consequences such as impairment of immune functions, performance status, muscle function, and quality of life. Furthermore, responses to chemotherapy are decreased, chemotherapy-induced toxicity and complications are more frequent and severe, and survival times are shortened.

A loss or reduction in appetite may be due also to psychological conditions, such as emotional or mental symptoms. More specifically, depression, anxiety, fatigue and malaise can lead to decreased appetite or other changes in eating habits, that also significantly impact on patient well-being and recovery.

Furthermore, they are distinct by psychological aspects, since they not involve personality and emotional or mood states.

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The need for cognitive closure is a dispositional construct, i.e., a personality trait that influences the knowledge acquisition process in rather stable ways across various situations. As construct, it is treated as a latent variable manifested through several aspects, such as desire for predictability, preference for order and structure, discomfort with ambiguity, decisiveness, and close-mindedness.

It is typical of patients that need to reduce the uncertainty. The possible consequence of cognitive closure (closing down the process of thinking-through), is that the individual may become intellectually passive, rather than developing a persistent and tenacious stance toward problem-solving. Thinking through multiple potentially correct answers requires a stick-with-it mentality, that when dealing with cancer might lead some patients to think too much to the negative events of having a cancer (a possible link with rumination, depression, anxiety).
