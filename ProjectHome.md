The Health Data Ontology Trunk (HDOT) is the middle-layer ontology developed by the Institute for Formal Ontology and Medical Information Science (IFOMIS) of the University of Saarland according to p-medicine WP4. HDOT is created using the ontology editor Protégé and released in OWL-DL.

The main goal of HDOT is to provide the semantic backbone of p-medicine, i.e. to specify how the meaning of the data relevant to the project can be managed and stored in computer format in order to have semantic standards for clinical needs.

HDOT is developed in a modular fashion in order to serve as semantic grid for data description, annotations, and interoperability demands of users.It is worth noting that both the classes and the modules of HDOT do not provide specific information details, but only those general semantic descriptions which can be further extended by p-medicine users themselves.

Together with the main backbone of HDOT, we have released the first version of the HDOT-pathological formation module, which represents medical information about cancer. A patient empowerment module is under development.

HDOT is currently under development.
